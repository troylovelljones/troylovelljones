<h3>While you're here, take a peek at my <em><a href="https://github.com/troylovelljones/SneakersApp">Sneakers App</em> Github repository.</a></h3>

I'm building a web app targeted at teenage boys and girls that allows them to...
- Arrange a virtual closet of sneakers chosen from a vast database of sneaker styles.
- Research the current price of a sneaker as listed on StockX, Goat, FlightClub).
- Value a sneaker in his/her collection based on the current market demand for that sneaker.
- Share his/her virtual sneaker with friends.

Within the month, I expect to have a fully functional site up and running at https://yoursneakercollection.com.  In the meantime there is a placeholder website which describes the genesis of the idea and demos the expected UI design language for the live version.
